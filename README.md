## Project Overview: Pok-Deng Game Implementation

Skooldio is building a simple Pok-Deng (ป๊อกเด้ง) game. Your task is to implement the following requirements:

## Game Rules:

### Betting:
- The game begins with the player placing a bet (e.g., 5 chips).

### Dealing Cards:
- The dealer shuffles a standard deck of cards and deals two cards to the player.
- The dealer receives the last pair of cards.

### Card Values:
- Ace = 1 point
- Cards 2 to 9 = their face values
- King, Queen, Jack, and 10 = 0 points

### Scoring:
- Compare your score with the dealer:
  - **Win**: You beat the dealer and receive a payout equal to your original bet.
  - **Tie**: You neither win nor lose chips.
  - **Lose**: You forfeit your bet to the dealer.

### Gameplay Continuation:
- After each round, the player chooses to continue or stop playing.
- If the player continues, the process starts again from step 1.

### End of Game:
- When the player decides to stop, display the net chips remaining.
